  Abstract                 = {We are surrounded by ever growing volumes of unstructured and weakly-structured information, and for a human being, either domain expert or not, it is nearly impossible to read, understand and categorize it in a fair amount of time. Moreover, different user categories have different expectations: final users need easy to use tools and services for specific tasks, knowledge engineers require robust tools for knowledge acquisition, knowledge categorization and semantic resources development, while semantic applications developers demand for flexible frameworks for fast and easy, standardized development of complex applications. The proposed system is based on CODA open architecture and demonstrates the hands-on experience of building a complete data acquisition workflow, including data extraction and transformation (triplification) for AGROVOC thesaurus enrichment. The system integrates, with an high level of autonomy, different NLP tools and custom libraries, following UIMA standards. In this perspective, the architecture, the implementation and experimental results will be discussed.},
